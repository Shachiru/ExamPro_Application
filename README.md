# ExamPro - Online Examination System

## Project Description

ExamPro is a secure and user-friendly online examination system that simplifies the testing process for both teachers and students. It allows teachers to create tests with various question types, including multiple choice, true/false, and short answer, while setting time limits and enabling automatic grading for objective questions. A real-time countdown timer helps students keep track of their remaining time during the exam, and the system ensures that only authorized users can access the tests, maintaining fairness and security.

A key feature of ExamPro is its integrated email notification system. This functionality sends timely updates to both teachers and students about exam schedules, upcoming tests, and released results. The email notifications are implemented using the JavaMail API within a Spring Boot framework. SMTP server settings—using providers like Gmail or SendGrid—are configured in the application’s properties file. A dedicated mail service, built on Spring’s JavaMailSender bean, constructs and sends email messages with appropriate recipient addresses, subject lines, and content. This seamless integration of email notifications helps keep everyone informed and enhances the overall exam experience by automating communication.
